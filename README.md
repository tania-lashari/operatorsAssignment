Assignment: Understanding Operators in TypeScript


Instructions:
1. Create a new TypeScript file (e.g., `operators.ts`) for this assignment.
2. Complete the following tasks in the TypeScript file:

Task 1: Arithmetic Operators
- Declare two variables, `num1` and `num2`, and initialize them with numerical values.
- Use arithmetic operators (`+, -, *, /, %`) to perform the following operations and print the results:
  - Addition
  - Subtraction
  - Multiplication
  - Division
  - Modulus

Task 2: Comparison Operators
- Declare two variables, `value1` and `value2`, and initialize them with numerical values.
- Use comparison operators (`==, !=, >, <, >=, <=`) to compare the values and print the results.

Task 3: Logical Operators
- Declare two boolean variables, `isTrue` and `isFalse`, and initialize them.
- Use logical operators (`&&, ||, !`) to combine the boolean values and print the results.

Task 4: String Concatenation
- Declare two string variables, `firstName` and `lastName`, and initialize them with your first and last name.
- Use the string concatenation operator (`+`) to create a full name and print it.

Task 5: Assignment Operators
- Declare a variable `count` and initialize it with a numerical value.
- Use assignment operators (`=, +=, -=, *=`) to modify the `count` variable and print the results.


Submission:
- Submit the TypeScript file (`operators.ts`) with comments explaining each task.
